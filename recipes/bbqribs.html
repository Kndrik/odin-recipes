        <p>This BBQ ribs recipe may be different than others you've tried, but for super tender ribs, give it a try! Lean, country-style pork ribs are boiled in seasoned water until tender, then finished up in the oven under a blanket of your favorite barbecue sauce as they bake to perfection. That's it! Back to simplicity, back to country life.</p>
